# FoundryVTT Modules Documentation
This repo contains the documentation to my modules.

## Contribuiting
I will carefully analyze all the pull requests, so feel free to contribute. Together we can make the docs easier to read and better to understand.

### Translation
Since mdBook lets you have multiple languages, I will kindly ask translation PRs to be verified by atleast one native speaker. That single native speaker can be you.
