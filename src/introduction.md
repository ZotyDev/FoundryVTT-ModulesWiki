## Modules

These are the modules that I currently develop and maintain:
- [Automated Objects, Interactions and Effects](./oif/introduction.md)
- [Wizard (Library)](./wizard/introduction.md)
- [Item Tags (Library)](./itemTags/introduction.md)

All my modules are open-source and licensed under MIT, no one will ever be charged a cent for the modules I make. But I do appreciate donations, if you want to support me I will be very happy :D
