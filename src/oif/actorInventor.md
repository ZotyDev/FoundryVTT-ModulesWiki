# Actor Inventor

_**This feature will be removed and inserted into a standalone module in the future**_

For now, the only feature is the currency generator, to use it you must:

1. Install [Tidy5e Sheet](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tidy5e-sheet)
2. Make sure the currency generator is enabled at the module's settings
3. Open the actor that you want to generate currency for when it gets added to the table
4. Insert the `generateCurrency` tag on the actor (just like other items)
5. [Setup the max currency it can hold](./specialTags.md#generatecurrency)
