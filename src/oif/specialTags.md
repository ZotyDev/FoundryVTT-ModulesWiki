# Special Tags

### `powerful`
Whe this tag is on a item, all of its attacks have a powerful impact that shakes the screen.

### `generateCurrency`
When this tag is on a unlinked actor and it gets added to the scene, the currency on the token will be randomly generated. The maximum amount of any currency is the value of it on the original actor.

**Example**:

You create a Goblin and set its gold pieces to `10` and silver pieces to `45`, the maximum gold it can have is `10`, same for the silver. When it gets added to the scene these fields will be generated randomly, gold pieces from `0` to `10` and silver pieces from `0` to `45`.

Leave the fields at `0` if you don't want currency to be generated.
