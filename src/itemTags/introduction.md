A FoundryVTT library that provides a way to insert and manage tags across almost all documents.

This is useful for storing simple data that can help module/macro developers create generic code and reuse it easily, it also allows some type of customization. The idea of tagging Items was born because I don't use English in my sessions, and relying on autodetect based on names to automate certain items was going to be too much for me to handle.
